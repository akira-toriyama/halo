# Create a persistent self-signed code-signing identity in the LOGIN
# keychain so the Accessibility (TCC) grant for Halo.app survives
# rebuilds.
#
# halo needs Accessibility ONLY for focus-shake (it moves the focused
# window via AX). If you run with `shake = false`, halo is permission-
# free and you don't need this script at all.
#
# Run ONCE. macOS may prompt to unlock your login keychain — that is
# the only interactive step. Afterwards `package.sh` auto-uses the
# identity (it writes the name to `.signing-id`).
#
# Why this works: TCC keys an app's grant to its code-signing
# identity. Ad-hoc (`codesign -s -`) has no stable identity, so every
# rebuild looks "new" and the grant is lost. A reused self-signed cert
# keeps the identity constant.
#
# Homebrew install subprocess can't reach the login keychain, so this
# script is for from-source builds. Homebrew users get ad-hoc signing
# and re-grant on every formula update (acceptable for the install
# model).
